# Four In A Row (Connect Four) Game and Bot for theaigames.com
## Written by John White 2016


## This is both a stand-alone game with human vs AI, and an parser that will work with theaigames.com's AI competitions.


### This code should demonstrate unit testing, exception handling, and proper class separation with few dependencies
###### (I am sure that in a few months/years I will be horrified by this code)


##### Currently there is no graphical interface, only text - it runs in a terminal.


Use ruby to run "connect_four_engine.rb" for single player Connect Four.
Currently player one is human and player two is a monte carlo bot.


Use ruby to run "game_parser.rb" to activate the parser. It waits silently for input.
The parser currently runs the monte carlo bot on all input.


If using this bot for theaigames.com, remove connect_four_engine.rb when uploading.
